Those experiments are part of a new setup in the VISIR oriented to master as well as experienced students and users that would like to increase their experience in industrial electronics and power components management. The development of the two experiments is explained along with the necessary configuration to the core-platform VISIR. This is preceded by a brief overview of VISIR, including its hardware and software components. Finally, the remote experimental results obtained are presented.},

Know-how transfer and collaboration in learning and teaching are aspects promoted and sustained by institutional management as well as the European initiatives. Thus, leading to the idea of a federation which will facilitate engineering education. A consortium formed by five European universities decided to join efforts to provide to the community a federation, which could be used by different stakeholders interest in teaching, learning or developing new skills in the field of electronics. The proposed remote system, Virtual Instruments System in Reality, or VISIR in short, offers the possibility of working with real equipment and obtain the real-world/ real-time measurements. By developing such a VISIR federation some of the constraints of using remote labs, the ones associated with development and maintenance costs, and scalability, will be minimized. This paper aims to present the initial steps for developing a VISIR Federation, which is also the primary goal of PILAR - Platform Integration of Laboratories based on the Architecture of visiR project.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on a state-of-the-art remote laboratory project called Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality (VISIR). VISIR allows wiring and measuring of electronic circuits remotely on a virtual workbench that replicates physical circuit breadboards. The wiring mechanism is developed by means of a relay switching matrix connected to a PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI) instrumentation platform. The entire equipment is controlled by LabVIEW server software, in addition to a measurement server software that protects the equipment from hazard connections by verifying input circuit designs, sent by students, before being executed. This paper addresses other approaches such as remote labs based on Data Acquisition Cards (DAQs), NetLab, and RemotElectLab, comparing them with VISIR in order to emphasize its singularity. Topics discussed are as follows: the technical description, software, operation cycle, features, and provided services. In addition, the feedback received by students at several universities and the encountered drawbacks along with the proposed solutions are highlighted. The paper finally addresses the ongoing and future challenges within the VISIR community including its integration with Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and iLab Shared Architecture (ISA), its new hardware version release that is based on LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation (LXI), and its new open platform version that supports federated access.},

The integration of remote laboratories in learning tools (learning management systems, content management systems, or personal learning environments) has been achieved to integrate remote laboratories as part of the learning curricula. A cross-institutional initiative called gateway4labs has been created to perform this integration extensible to multiple remote laboratories in multiple learning tools. This contribution focuses on describing this initiative and, in particular, how opening it to public systems (where users do not need to be registered) produces new technical and organizational challenges due to the public availability of labs. In addition, this contribution shows integrations of systems that were not previously addressed in this initiative, such as PhET or ViSH, as well as a new approach for integrating supported laboratories in external specifications such as the smart device one through OpenSocial.},

  abstract  = {An educational remote laboratory is a software and hardware tool that allows students to remotely access real equipment located in universities or educational centers. Federations of remote laboratories have existed for years: students of one university transparently access laboratories of other university through software systems that enable these contracts. However, traditionally these contracts have been defined in a “one to one” basis and both universities using the same remote laboratory management system. The focus of this contribution is to present different interoperable bridges among different remote laboratory systems and explore how they can be chained to build complex ecosystems of remote laboratories. The impact of this chaining is that, if successful, it would definitely contribute to the adoption of remote laboratories.},

The iLab architecture focuses on fast platform-independent lab development, scalable access for students, and efficient management for lab providers while preserving the autonomy of the faculty actually teaching the students. Over the past two years, the iLab architecture has been adopted by an increasing number of partner universities in Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and the United States. The iLab project has demonstrated that online laboratory use can scale to thousands of students dispersed on several continents.},

These platforms are VISIR (Virtual Systems in Reality) and the iLab Shared Architecture (ISA). While VISIR delivers, among others, electronics experiments in a highly flexible online workbench where circuits can be built and tested in a similar way as in traditional hands on laboratories, ISA focuses in providing mechanisms for sharing online laboratories in a distributed Web services based architecture by managing lab session scheduling and maintenance while a experiment is executed. Opening VISIR based labs to use the standard online lab support services provided by the ISA brings several advantages to both sides.},

  abstract  = {Experimentation in laboratories is a key pillar in the education of graduate and undergraduate students, who need to understand the fundamental concepts from both perspectives: theoretical and practical. High costs associated with equipment, space, and maintenance staff, impose certain constraints on resources for traditional laboratories. While, Virtual and Remote Laboratories can overcome these limitations, they present important limitations in their use. Some actions are repetitive in nature, cannot be executed trivially or in reasonable time by a user. Some others might be simply impossible without computer help. For example, doing a linear regression of values obtained in an experiment, performing a comparison of results obtained by making a sweep in the values of a particular variable or taking a system to an initial state. Hence, it arises the need of encoding some experimental tasks to automatize their execution. With other existing applications, to encode experiments, users need to know how VRLs are implemented. In addition, they have to manage the language in which the simulation was created so they need to handle fluently a simulation language just to perform experiments. The authors propose a tool called the Experiment Editor, to undertake automated experiments for VRLs. The Experiment Editor enables the user to encode experiments regardless of the language in which the laboratory was implemented. To do so, it provides a powerful and easy-to-learn language, and the corresponding interpreter that supports the execution of the experiments.},

The teacher has the opportunity to monitor the development of tasks and student code of the program, where the functionality of these tasks can be verified.

As many as 53\% (n = 8) of those students who could improve their results achieved an improvement of one or up to two tasks during class. Before the IoT remote laboratory application, up to 30\% (n = 6) of students could not solve any task and only 25\% (n = 5) solved two tasks (full number of tasks) during the class. Before implementation, 45\% (n = 9) solved one problem. After applying the IoT remote laboratory, these numbers increased significantly and up to 50% (n = 10) of students solved the full number of tasks.

The physical setup and communication principles of hardware architecture are based on two types of devices: the programmable logic controllers and industrial network routers. The user interface of client application is designed as a Web page, powered by optimized JavaScript, using the sophisticated on-the-fly content generation. To prove the suitability of the architecture, we compare it with other existing approaches of remote laboratory design. We evaluate their benefits and weaknesses, especially in terms of expense, implementation difficulty, and versatility of usage. In this paper, we also show a detailed example of remote laboratory implementation based on new architecture for thermo-optical educational system and provide three other examples of developed remote laboratories. Evaluation of remote laboratory usage and its benefits is provided to demonstrate the learning value of proposed architecture in education process.},

  abstract = {Within education, concepts such as distance learning, and open universities, are now becoming more widely used for teaching and learning. However, due to the nature of the subject domain, the teaching of Science, Technology, and Engineering are still relatively behind when using new technological approaches (particularly for online distance learning). The reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact that these fields often require laboratory exercises to provide effective skill acquisition and hands-on experience. Often it is difficult to make these laboratories accessible for online access. Either the real lab needs to be enabled for remote access or it needs to be replicated as a fully software-based virtual lab. We argue for the latter concept since it offers some advantages over remotely controlled real labs, which will be elaborated further in this paper. We are now seeing new emerging technologies that can overcome some of the potential difficulties in this area. These include: computer graphics, augmented reality, computational dynamics, and virtual worlds. This paper summarizes the state of the art in virtual laboratories and virtual worlds in the fields of science, technology, and engineering. The main research activity in these fields is discussed but special emphasis is put on the field of robotics due to the maturity of this area within the virtual-education community. This is not a coincidence; starting from its widely multidisciplinary character, robotics is a perfect example where all the other fields of engineering and physics can contribute. Thus, the use of virtual labs for other scientific and non-robotic engineering uses can be seen to share many of the same learning processes. This can include supporting the introduction of new concepts as part of learning about science and technology, and introducing more general engineering knowledge, through to supporting more constructive (and collaborative) education and training activities in a more complex engineering topic such as robotics. The objective of this paper is to outline this problem space in more detail and to create a valuable source of information that can help to define the starting position for future research.}

  abstract = {This review presents the first attempt to synthesize recent (post-2005) empirical studies that focus on directly comparing learning outcome achievement using traditional lab (TL; hands-on) and non-traditional lab (NTL; virtual and remote) participants as experimental groups. Findings suggest that most studies reviewed (n = 50, 89\%) demonstrate student learning outcome achievement is equal or higher in NTL versus TL across all learning outcome categories (knowledge and understanding, inquiry skills, practical skills, perception, analytical skills, and social and scientific communication), though the majority of studies (n = 53, 95\%) focused on outcomes related to content knowledge, with most studies (n = 40, 71\%) employing quizzes and tests as the assessment instrument. Scientific inquiry skills was the least assessed learning objective (n = 4, 7\%), and lab reports/written assignments (n = 5, 9\%) and practical exams (n = 5, 9\%) were the least common assessment instrument. The results of this review raise several important concerns and questions to be addressed by future research.}

  abstract = {Industry 4.0, an initiative from Germany, has become a globally adopted term in the past decade. Many countries have introduced similar strategic initiatives, and a considerable research effort has been spent on developing and implementing some of the Industry 4.0 technologies. At the ten-year mark of the introduction of Industry 4.0, the European Commission announced Industry 5.0. Industry 4.0 is considered to be technology-driven, whereas Industry 5.0 is value-driven. The co-existence of two Industrial Revolutions invites questions and hence demands discussions and clarifications. We have elected to use five of these questions to structure our arguments and tried to be unbiased for the selection of the sources of information and for the discussions around the key issues. It is our intention that this article will spark and encourage continued debate and discussion around these topics.}

  abstractnote = {A introdução de e-learning no Ensino Superior é um processo com alguma sistematização e algum sucesso a nível mundial. Mesmo em Portugal a generalidade das Instituições de Ensino Superior apresenta já iniciativas de e-learning embora o âmbito das mesmas seja extremamente diverso e sendo poucas as que promovem efectivamente alternativas reais de aprendizagem baseadas em tecnologias de informação e comunicação. Pelo contrário, estas iniciativas centram-se essencialmente no uso das plataformas de e-learning no apoio documental às disciplinas académicas presenciais. O carácter exploratório da iniciativa de e-learning do Instituto Superior de Ciências Empresariais e do Turismo (ISCET), um Instituto do Ensino Superior Politécnico privado, tem características próprias que promovem o seu interesse científico e académico. Por um lado, porque a iniciativa decorre da visão estratégica do Instituto e da necessária adequação da sua prática académica ao paradigma de Bolonha. Por outro lado, porque a sua dimensão (número de alunos, professores e cursos) permitiu uma abordagem holistica, com uma avaliação permanente de todo o processo. Este artigo descreve precisamente essa avaliação ao longo do semestre inicial de arranque em que se procedeu à disponibilização de ambientes online para a totalidade do corpo de disciplinas oferecidas no ISCET e à definição dos modelos pedagógicos adaptados às especificidades de cada disciplina.

  abstract   = {A problemática do e-learning entrou claramente na agenda dos temas educacionais em debate, sendo que o termo e-learning é actualmente um dos mais discutidos no domínio da utilização das tecnologias na educação/formação. É cada vez mais necessária uma reflexão em torno do conceito de e-learning que facilite a comunicação e estabeleça limites em relação à utilização do termo. Essa reflexão mais do que procurar formulações ou definições rígidas deve promover a discussão em torno dos factores que melhor podem justificar a adopção de nova terminologia no domínio da utilização das tecnologias de informação e comunicação na educação. Neste sentido, defende-se uma adopção do termo e-learning menos centrada nos aspectos tecnológicos e mais próxima do potencial pedagógico decorrente do uso das “tecnologias de redes” no desenho de situações de formação a distância baseada na interacção e na colaboração, no sentido da construção de aprendizagens significativas.},

Virtual laboratories, or simulations, can be used to promote a more active role of students when studying certain phenomena. Remote laboratories add the extra value of using real hardware, typically at a distant location, which shows students the additional issues that appear when using real equipment. These pedagogical benefits are particularly effective if the laboratories are designed to be used using an Interactive Engagement approach. Our work, which received the gift of the collaboration with many other people interested in improving education, in particular in Physics and Control Engineering, has taught us what are the features and software platforms required to create virtual and remote laboratories. We review the lessons learned from the past ten years of successful outcomes and how we apply these lessons to prepare for the integration of computers, tablets, and other mobile devices with platform-independent cloud-based computing and laboratories.}

  abstract = {Remote Laboratories have become part of current teaching and learning, particularly in engineering. Their potential to aid students beyond their hands-on lab classes has been a matter of discussion in literature. Teachers and researchers are aware that the thorough analysis of both strengths and shortcomings of remote labs in didactical implementations may not only lead to the improvement of these resources but also of the pedagogical implications in engineering classes. The present study was carried out in a Higher Education Institution in Brazil in two different courses during three consecutive semesters where a remote lab (VISIR) addressing electric and electronic topics was implemented, yielding 471 students' academic results and opinions. These students' results (while using VISIR) cross-analysed with the course characteristics, reveal some factors teachers may tackle to foster student learning and motivation. The conclusions point to the need for VISIR interface modernization and showed it is more useful in basic courses than in more advanced ones, when dealing with classic lab experiments. Results also show that teachers' involvement plus their ability to brief students on VISIR's usefulness have a significant influence not only on students' performance but also on their perception of learning and satisfaction with the tool. In the analysed cases, the students with more learning needs seemed to be the ones who could benefit more from VISIR.}

  abstract = {A large-scale, multi-year, randomized study compared learning activities and outcomes for hands-on, remotely-operated, and simulation-based educational laboratories in an undergraduate engineering course. Students (N = 458) worked in small-group lab teams to perform two experiments involving stress on a cantilever beam. Each team conducted the experiments in one of three lab formats (hands-on, remotely-operated, or simulation-based), collecting data either individually or as a team. Lab format and data-collection mode showed an interaction, such that for the hands-on lab format learning outcomes were higher when the lab team collected data sets working as a group rather than individually collecting data sets to be combined later, while for remotely-operated labs individual data collection was best. The pattern of time spent on various lab-related activities suggests that working with real instead of simulated data may induce higher levels of motivation. The results also suggest that learning with computer-mediated technologies can be improved by careful design and coordination of group and individual activities.}

  abstract   = {Laboratories play a crucial role in the education of future scientists and engineers, yet there is disagreement among science and engineering educators about whether and which types of technology-enabled labs should be used. This debate could be advanced by large-scale randomized studies addressing the critical issue of whether remotely operated or simulation-based labs are as effective as the traditional hands-on lab format. The present article describes the results of a large-scale (N = 306) study comparing learning outcomes and student preferences for several different lab formats in an undergraduate engineering course. The lab formats that were evaluated included traditional hands-on labs, remotely operated labs, and simulations. Learning outcomes were assessed by a test of the specific concepts taught in each lab. These knowledge scores were as high or higher (depending on topic) after performing remote and simulated laboratories versus performing hands-on laboratories. In their responses to survey items, many students saw advantages to technology-enabled lab formats in terms of such attributes as convenience and reliability, but still expressed preference for hands-on labs. Also, differences in lab formats led to changes in group functions across the plan-experiment-analyze process: For example, students did less face-to-face work when engaged in remote or simulated laboratories, as opposed to hands-on laboratories.},

However, the lack of practical sessions due to the high costs of the equipment and the unavailability of instructors has caused a significant declination in experimentation in engineering education. Remote laboratories have tackled this issues providing online reusable and shared workbenches unconstrained by neither geographical nor time considerations. Thereby, they have extremely proliferated among universities and integrated into engineering curricula over the last decade. This contribution compiles diverse experiences based on the deployment of the remote laboratory, Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality (VISIR), on the practices of undergraduate engineering grades at various universities within the VISIR community. It aims to show the impact of its usage on engineering education concerning the assessments of students and teachers as well. In addition, the paper address the next challenges and future works carried out at several universities within the VISIR community.},
